## **Installation**

To install the package, simply run the following command:

```bash
npm i vue-apicaller
```

## **Usage**

To use the package, first import it into your Vue component:

```

Next , you can use the package's methods to make API calls and handle the responses:

```js
const { data, error, execute, isAborted, isFinished, isLoading, registerSuccessCallback, registerErrorCallback } = apiCaller();
```

Additionally, the package provides a comprehensive state management system, allowing you to keep track of the progress of your API calls.

execute();

```

## **Recommended Usage**

Use hooks

export function useFetchPosts() {
  return apiCall("/some-endpoint", { method: "GET" });
}
```

```js
import { useFetchPosts } from "./api/posts";
import { onMounted } from "vue";
const {
  execute: fetchPosts,
  registerErrorCallback: onError,
  registerSuccessCallback: onSuccess,
} = useFecthPosts();

onError((error) => {
  console.error("Something went wrong", error);
});

onSuccess((posts) => {
  console.log("Posts", posts);
});

onMounted(() => {
  fetchPosts();
});
```
